# 🖼️ Skin Lesion Multi-Class Classification (PART 2)

## 📚 Overview
Multi-class classification of skin lesions to distinguish **melanoma** (mel) from **Basal-cell carcinoma** (bcc) and from **Squamous cell cancer** (scc)
This is the second part of a the Skin Lesion Classification project

## 🧰 Methods
- **Preprocessing**: Intensity scaling, image resizing, black border and hair removal.
- **Feature Extraction**: Color features, texture analysis (GLCM, LBP, entropy, kurtosis, contrast), Gabor filters.
- **Classification**: Machine learning models optimized for accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Class imbalance**: Smote, borderline smote, hybrid class balancing.

## 📈 Results
Promising performance in melanoma detection with high accuracy.
Received a 0.70 kappa on unseen test data.
